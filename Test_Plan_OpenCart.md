# Test Plan for OpenCart Demo Website

## 1. **Introduction**
This document outlines the test plan for the OpenCart demo website (https://demo.opencart.com). The objective is to ensure the website functions as expected, is free of critical defects, and meets business requirements.

## 2. **Scope**
### In Scope:
1. **Functional Testing:**
   - User Registration and Login
   - Product Search
   - Product Details Page
   - Shopping Cart Operations
   - Checkout Process
   - Payment Gateway Simulation
   - Order History and Tracking

2. **Non-Functional Testing:**
   - Performance Testing
   - Security Testing (basic level for demo purposes)
   - Usability Testing
   - Compatibility Testing (browser and device)

3. **Automation Testing:**
   - Automating regression and smoke test suites using Python + Playwright.

4. **AI-Driven Enhancements:**
   - Using AI to analyze test coverage and suggest additional test scenarios.
   - AI-assisted reporting and analysis.

### Out of Scope:
- Integration with third-party systems not accessible via the demo.
- Load testing for production-level traffic.

## 3. **Test Objectives**
- Validate core functionality of the website.
- Ensure a seamless user experience across multiple browsers and devices.
- Detect performance bottlenecks and regressions.
- Automate repetitive and regression-prone test cases.

## 4. **Testing Approach**
### **4.1 Test Levels:**
- **Unit Testing:** Not applicable as focus is on black-box testing.
- **Integration Testing:** Verify the interaction between various modules (e.g., cart and checkout).
- **System Testing:** Comprehensive testing of end-to-end workflows.
- **Acceptance Testing:** Validate against business requirements.

### **4.2 Test Types:**
- **Functional Testing:** Manual and automated testing of all user workflows.
- **Performance Testing:** Using Playwright with Lighthouse to measure page load times.
- **Visual Regression Testing:** Using tools like Applitools.
- **Security Testing:** Basic validation of authentication and session handling.

## 5. **Test Environment**
### **5.1 Hardware:**
- Desktop: Windows 11, macOS Ventura
- Mobile: Android and iOS devices (via emulators and real devices)

### **5.2 Software:**
- Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari
- Tools:
  - **Playwright**: Automation testing
  - **VS Code**: IDE
  - **Faker (Python)**: Test data generation
  - **Allure Reporting**: Test result visualization
  - **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD
  - **Applitools**: Visual testing

### **5.3 Test Data:**
- Synthetic data generated using the Faker library for user credentials, products, and order information.

## 6. **Test Cases** (link will be added to test case document)
A detailed test case document will be maintained separately. Example test cases include:
1. Verify user can register successfully with valid details.
2. Verify products can be added to the cart.
3. Verify checkout process works correctly with valid payment details.
4. Verify search functionality displays relevant results.
5. Verify UI renders correctly across all supported browsers and devices.

## 7. **Automation Plan**
- Framework: Custom-built using Python + Playwright.
- Structure: Page Object Model (POM) for maintainability.
- Scope:
  - Regression Testing
  - Smoke Testing
  - Data-Driven Testing for critical flows (e.g., checkout).
- AI Integration:
  - Analyze test results to suggest additional test cases.
  - Self-healing test scripts for UI changes.

## 8. **Defect Management**
- Tool: GitHub Issues
- Workflow:
  1. Defects logged with detailed steps to reproduce, priority, and severity.

## 9. **Risk Management**
| Risk                             | Mitigation Plan                                      |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Limited browser compatibility    | Use cross-browser testing tools like Playwright.    |
| Test data inconsistencies        | Automate test data generation using Faker.          |
| Flaky automated tests            | Use AI for self-healing scripts and result analysis.|
| Delays in execution              | Prioritize critical workflows and run parallel tests|

## 10. **Exit Criteria**
- All critical test cases executed with a pass rate of 95%.
- No open high-priority defects.
- Test report shared with stakeholders.

## 11. **Deliverables**
- Test Plan Document
- Test Cases
- Test Automation Scripts
- Test Execution Report
- Defect Logs

## 12. **Conclusion**
This test plan provides a structured approach to ensure the quality of the OpenCart demo website. By combining manual and automated testing with AI-driven enhancements, we aim to deliver a reliable and user-friendly application.
